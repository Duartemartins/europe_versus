# EuropeVersus 🇪🇺

![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-28.2%25-red)

An **open source** Rails 8 web application that provides evidence-based comparisons between European statistics and those of the United States, India, and China. This project aims to counter negative narratives about Europe by presenting factual data in an accessible, visual format.

## 🎯 Mission

EuropeVersus promotes data-driven understanding of European performance across multiple dimensions. Too often, discussions about Europe focus on challenges without acknowledging the continent's remarkable achievements in quality of life, social progress, and sustainable development.

**This is an open source, community-driven project.** We believe that accurate data should be freely accessible and continuously improved by contributors worldwide.

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Comprehensive Statistics**: Compare Europe with the US, India, and China across economics, social indicators, environment, and innovation
- **🎨 Beautiful Visualizations**: Clean, responsive design with interactive comparison charts
- **📱 Mobile-First**: Optimized for all devices with Tailwind CSS
- **⚡ Fast & Modern**: Built with Rails 8, Turbo, SQLite, and minimal JavaScript
- **🔍 Evidence-Based**: All data sourced from official statistics and reputable international organizations

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 8
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, Turbo, Stimulus
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready with Kamal configuration


## 📊 Data Categories

The application includes statistics across four main categories, with data sourced from Our World in Data and other reputable sources:

### 🏦 Economy
- GDP per Capita (PPP)
- GDP Growth Rate
- Unemployment Rate

### 👥 Social
- Life Expectancy
- Life Satisfaction (Cantril Ladder)
- Health Expenditure (% of GDP)
- Education Index
- Social Progress Index

### 🌍 Environment
- CO2 Emissions per Capita
- Renewable Energy Share
- Environmental Performance Index
- Electricity Access

### 💡 Innovation
- Global Innovation Index
- R&D Spending (% of GDP)

## 📥 Adding New Metrics

**Zero-terminal workflow!** Just edit a YAML file and deploy.

1. **Add to `config/owid_metrics.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   renewable_energy:
     owid_slug: renewable-energy-consumption
     start_year: 1990
     end_year: 2024
     unit: "terawatt-hours"
     description: "Renewable energy consumption"
     aggregation_method: population_weighted
     enabled: true
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add config/owid_metrics.yml
   git commit -m "Add renewable energy metric"
   git push
   ```

3. **Deploy** → The app automatically imports new metrics on startup! ✅

See [ADDING_METRICS_GUIDE.md](ADDING_METRICS_GUIDE.md) for complete instructions. For detailed setup and development information, see [DATA_SETUP.md](DATA_SETUP.md).

**How it works:**
- On startup, the app checks `config/owid_metrics.yml`
- New metrics (not yet in database) are automatically imported
- Data is fetched from OWID and Europe/EU-27 aggregates are calculated
- No manual terminal commands needed in production
